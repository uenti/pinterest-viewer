so basically i got tired of having to sign in to pinterest, so i made a script download images via the console
# how to use
1. find the image you want and open the link to it
2. press `f12` and go into the console then paste the script
3. press enter and it should ask where you want to download the image, once you press save then thats it!

thats it ^^
