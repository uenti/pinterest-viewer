# pinterest-viewer
so basically i got tired of having to sign in to pinterest, so i made a script download images via the console
# how to use
1. find the image you want and open the link to it
2. press `f12` and go into the console then paste the script
3. press enter and it should bring you to the image opened in the tab where you can right click and save it without pinterest blocking you from doing so

thats it ^^
